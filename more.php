      <h4>Background:</h4>
      <p>Gomoa Central District is one of the twenty (20) Districts in the Central Region of Ghana.</p>
      <p>The District was carved out as a separate district from the then Gomoa District in June 2008 by
      the Legislative instrument 1883</p>
      <p>It occupies an area of <b>539.69</b> square kilometers with a total projected 2016 population 
        of <b>240,581,</b> comprising <b>47.5</b> percent males and <b>52.7</b> percent females with
        <b>2.5</b> growth rate (2010 PHC). The district has population density of <b>384</b> persons per
         square kilometer.</p>

        <p>The districted is situated between latitudes 5⁰14' north and 5⁰35' north and longitude 00⁰22'
        west, and 00⁰54' west.  It is located in the south-eastern part of the Central Region. 
        <br/>
      It is bordered by a number of districts:</p><br/>
      <li>The north-east by Agona East</li><br/>
      <li>South - west by Gomoa West</li><br/>
      <li>To the east by Awutu Senya and Ga South in the Greater Accra Region</li><br/>

        <p>Aesthetic features and Land Management. The district is endowed with many aesthetic features
          forming a good for tourism development. The district boasts itself of a stream of beautiful
          and prestigious hospitality homes dotted along the pristine coastline of Fetteh and Dampase.
        </p>
        <p>These attract over 15,000 tourists and holiday makers from Accra and other places. The coastal
        plain is dotted with rock outcrops which give a beautiful landscape. </p>
        <p>The Yenku Forest Reserve and the Yenku afforestation belt are found in the semi deciduous forest area.
        These can be further developed for eco-tourism which apart from conserving the ecosystem can also serve as 
        a potential revenue base for the district and create jobs for people in the immediate environment. The 
        "Gomoa two weeks" festival can be repackaged to give more meaning to cultural tourism in the district.

       <h4>Governance Issues (Functions and structure)</h4>
       <p>By law, the Gomoa Central District Assembly established by Legislative Instrument 1883 in 2008, constitutes

        <h4>Social and Culture Structure</h4>
        <p>The culture of the people in the district is seen in their way of life which
          distinguishes them from people in other districts. This is expressed in their 
          Dressing, languages spoken, festivals, art and craft, food, religious belief and
          occupation among others. According to the 2010 PHC the district is inhabited mainly
          by people of Gomoa origin who form over 95 percent of the population with the remaining 
          8 percent coming from Northern Ghana, the Volta region and other Akan ethnic groups.
          </p>
          <p>The communal spirit among the people is seen in the corporate as well as individual 
          responsibilities of members in the communities. Members in a community attend and participate 
          in ceremonies such as marriages, funerals and christening.
          Participants at these ceremonies make donations as their contribution to the host to pay expenses 
          incurred. Ocassionally, communal work is organized to do clean-ups as well as construction of 
          other community projects.</p>
          <p>The communities are well organized and the Asafo groups (military wings) are noted for their 
          mobilization instincts. </p>
